COLLEGIATE SYSTEM IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PORT HARCOURT.
[SP/2014-2015/012F]",1/28/2015,27,"The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and Chairman of the Committee Prof. A. I. Joe,presented the above Report. He reminded Senate that the Committee was mandated to:

look into the structure of existing Colleges except College of Health Sciences;
Look into proposals for establishment of new Colleges from Faculties for review andharmonization, and 
Make recommendations to Senate.

On the structure of existing Colleges, the Committee noted that the College of Naturaland Applied Sciences and College of Engineering both have three Faculties each, butonly one Faculty each, namely the Faculty of Physical Sciences and InformationTechnology and the Faculty of Process and Energy Systems Engineering respectively,met the requirement of a minimum of four departments in a Faculty, as approved bySenate at its 397th Meeting held on Wednesday, 26th March, 2014.

Senate was further informed that the College of Natural and Applied Sciences and
College of Engineering were informed of the Committee’s observations and were
requested to restructure in order to meet the minimum criteria for the establishment ofColleges. While the College of Natural and Applied Sciences wrote back to theCommittee insisting that the College will remain as it is and as earlier approved bySenate, the College of Engineering presented another proposal to restructure to twoFaculties having four Departments each.

On the Faculties seeking to be transformed into Colleges, the Chairman of the
Implementation Committee stated that the Faculties of Social Sciences and Education didnot meet the requirement since they presently have four Departments and sevenDepartments respectively. However, the Committee found the proposal of the Facultyof Humanities satisfactory. The Faculty presently has nine Departments and had proposedto be transformed into a College of Humanities to be made of two Faculties having fiveand four Departments each. The Committee also noted that the Faculties of Agriculture,Management Sciences and Pharmaceutical Sciences did not request for College status.

Findings

The Committee found out that, only two Colleges can be created presently based onSenate guidelines. These are College of Engineering and College of Humanities.

Recommendations

The Committee recommended to Senate as follows:
The establishment of two Colleges for now in the University; namelyCollege of Humanities and College of Engineering.

If the College of Natural and Applied Sciences wishes to remain a College, then itneeds to re-arrange all the Departments in the College to have two Faculties thatare appropriately named and until it does so, the College of Natural and AppliedSciences should revert to status quo ante.

The Senate may need to review the 4-tier collegiate system to 3-tier CollegiateSystem – Head of Department, Provost and Vice-Chancellor. Thisrecommendation is based on the fact that the structure will reduce bureaucracy,cost and improve administrative efficiency.

The University should ensure that there are adequate office spaces and facilitiesbefore the commencement of the collegiate system.

The financial implication of switching to 4-tier Collegiate System is enormous.The University must put this into consideration because additional staff and facilities may be needed to switch over to collegiate system.

More importantly, the Administration needs to seek approval from the NigerianUniversities Commission (NUC) before the Colleges can take off as required bythe Statute of the University Act, Section (3)(1) (a), which states thus:
to establish such campuses, colleges, institutes, schools, extra-muraldepartments and other teaching research units within the University asmay from time to time seem necessary or desirable, subject to the approvalof the National Universities Commission.

Senate thanked the Committee for the Report and on a motion by Prof. (Mrs.) A.R. Nte, seconded by Prof. S.U. Ejezie adopted it for deliberation.

Following due deliberation on the Report, Senate directed that:

Any student found in an Examination Hallwith Phone is guilty of Examination Malpractice.

Senate also recalled that it directed the Dean, Faculty of Law, to look at the Section onExamination Malpractice in the University’s Statement of Academic Policies and advise asappropriate.

The Dean of the Faculty of Law, Prof. K. S. A. Ebeku, in his report drew Senate’s attentionto Regulation 23 of the Statement of Academic Policies i.e. “Procedures for Investigation ofExamination Malpractices” and Regulation 23.1 which defines “Examination Malpractice” as“all forms of cheating which directly or indirectly [seek to] falsify the ability of the Student”.

He further referred Senate to Regulation 23.1, Section A, item 15 (Using an electronic deviceto cheat, e.g. handset, iPad, iPod etc). The Dean argued that Regulation 23.1, Section A(item 15) read together with Regulation 23.2.1 covered the Senate decision at the 402ndMeeting. He however agreed that the above Senate decision was clearer, wider andexplicit than the relevant extant regulations, as it explicitly forbids Students from entering anexamination hall with phone.

In view of the above, the Dean then made a case for the revision of the existing regulation onthe matter to adequately capture the decision of Senate. Specifically, the Dean advised Senateto revise Regulation 23.1 Section A (item 15) to read as follows:

ENTERING AN EXAMINATION HALL/ROOM WITH AN
ELECTRONIC DEVICE, E.G. HANDSET/MOBILE
PHONE, I-PAD, I-POD, ETC. WHETHER OR NOT IT
HAS BEEN USED TO CHEAT.

Where a student violates this regulation he/she will be liable to have the handset/mobile phone or other electronic device seized in accordance with Regulation 23.2.1. The objectmay be kept in the Faculty/Department or with the Security Department as an exhibitpending the investigation of the case or released to the student upon signing anundertaking to provide it if needed by the Faculty/Departmental Panel and/or the SenateCommittee on Examination Malpractice during the hearing of the case.

He informed Senate that the standardpractice in all universities in the country was that students, on resumption, pay their fees, registertheir courses, attend lectures and prepare for examinations. He regretted that over the years,
students of the University of Port Harcourt have developed the habit of writing examinationwithout paying their charges and registering their courses. The Vice-Chancellor informed Senatethat the above situation had resulted in innumerable challenges in administering examinations.

He recalled that in response to the ugly development, Senate had, at its 381st Meeting approvedthat any student who fails to pay his or her charges in a session would lose his or her studentshipfor that session and would repeat the session. The Vice-Chancellor also informed that Senaterecently at its 405th Meeting abolished the 50% surcharge on late payment and approved that any
student who fails to register at the beginning of each session shall roll over to the next sessionand such student shall be required to apply for temporary withdrawal from studies. The decisionalso spelt out that only students who register their courses shall be treated as students for thesession concerned.
In furtherance of the above, the Vice-Chancellor informed Senate that he held a meeting with theProvost, College of Health Sciences, Dean of Faculties, Heads and Ag. Heads of Department aswell as Directors of Academic Units, on Friday, 8th April, 2016, to brief them on theimplementation of the Senate directive. He also informed Senate that the UniversityManagement sensitized the students on the policy through the Ag. Dean of Student Affairs.

Parents and Guardians of the students were also sensitized through meetings with them andthrough bulk (sms) short message service.He briefed Senate on how the Management made a number of concessions to the students and
their parents by extending the deadline for registration four times beyond the 6 weeks stipulatedin the Statement of Academic Policies.

The Vice-Chancellor also briefed Senate on the meetings he held with the leadership of thestudents as well as the security measures taken by the administration to ensure peaceful conductof the First Semester examinations but regretted that the Police failed to take appropriatemeasures to secure property on campus. He described the violent protest by students as mostfrivolous and farcical as the students were not protesting failure or lack of municipal services asin some other universities, but asking that they be allowed to write examination on their ownterms. He informed Senate that he contemplated closing the University but was advised by someformer Vice-Chancellors against taking that measure unilaterally.

Senate deliberated on the Vice-Chancellor’s briefing on the violent demonstration by studentsand the resultant disruption of the First Semester Examination of the 2015/2016 Session. Senatetherefore resolved as follows:

The University sent bulk short message service (sms) to parents to advise their wards to
abandon plans to disrupt the examinations. The Executive of the University of Port HarcourtParents‟ Forum in turn, sent sms to their members to avert the crisis. The SecurityDepartment contacted the Police and Department of State Services (DSS) to enable them plancontingency measures aimed at frustrating the planned protest. By Sunday evening, theManagement of the University held meetings aimed at forestalling the crisis. The ChiefSecurity Officer was directed to step up security measures, including Police Patrols.

PART-TIME PROGRAMME [SP/2015-2016/053B]",4/20/2016,15-16,"Senate received the above submission from the Ag. Director, College of ContinuingEducation, Dr. K. K. Aaron. The Acting Director reported that:

1. Some very senior colleagues, for pecuniary considerations, cause themselves to beallocated more courses than they could meaningfully teach and end up sending their„boys‟ or „girls‟ to teach on their behalf. These courses taught by these younger colleagues are in most cases, final year courses which ought not to be taught by juniorcolleagues.
2. Results are not released in good time, in some cases up to one year after anexamination is taken. The consequence is that students, out of uncertainty of their fate,end up writing an examination which they may have passed while those who fail to write automatically carry over the course. In one instance, the lecturer went ahead toadminister the examination in spite of the 
directive from the College to the contrary.
3. Lecturers accumulate teaching and related claims, in some cases, up to 8 years andsubmit them any day it pleases them. Needless to add, preparing such claims comes atgreat cost in terms of administrative time and energy.

Senate however, observed that the College Academic Board was yet to deliberate on thematter and the Report was not routed through it. Senate therefore stepped downconsideration of the Report and referred it to the College Academic Board for considerationfirst before representation to Senate, if necessary.",Degree

Prof.Akpokodje posited that the present anti-plagiarism software used by the University “onlydetects plagiarism from online sources and does not address the more fundamental andimportant cases of theses (B.Sc, M.Sc, Ph.D) from other Nigerian Universities which aremostly not published online”. He informed Senate that some supervisors have found caseswhere students plagiarized whole theses from other Nigerian universities.

Citing some cases of INRES students disqualified for plagiarism, Prof. Akpokodje said 90%of the alleged cases of plagiarism were in Chapters One and Two which in Science-basedtheses are considered “peripheral” while no plagiarism was detected in the Abstract andChapters Three, Four and Five which are the core of the theses. He also informed Senate thatsome of the text marked as plagiarized are titles, subtitles and names of regions. Hetherefore appealed to the University to exercise caution in the application of the Report of thecurrent Anti-Plagiarism Software and to revisit the criteria used to disqualify students.
On a motion by Prof. H. L. Bell-Gam seconded by Prof. J. O. Osuji, the Report was adoptedfor deliberation.

Senate deliberated extensively on the Report. It noted that only about 15% of studentscurrently fail the Anti-Plagiarism test and that students are at liberty to check their workusing the turnitin software before submission.

Alapiki drew the attention of Senate to the roles played by Senate Representatives in the Governing Council of the University in the crisis the University experienced following the violent protest by students on April 11, 2016. 

He equally recalled the role played by Senate Representatives in the purported suspension of the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. N.E.S. Lale, and the Appointment of an Acting Vice-Chancellor by the Governing Council without recourse to Senate in violation of extant laws. Senate was also informed that the setting up of a Panel by the Governing Council to investigate the violent protest by students amounted to usurpation of its powers.

Prof. Alapiki recalled the decisions of the Governing Council at its 133rd Meeting held on Thursday, 5th April, 2012 which extended the tenure of Senate Representatives in the Governing Council to four years and guaranteed continuity of tenure of its Representatives on dissolution of Council without proper recourse to it which Senate at its 384th Meeting held on Wednesday, 6th June, 2012, merely noted but maintained that it has the power to recall its Representative that is not performing creditably. 

He therefore moved a motion that all Senate Representatives in the last Governing Council be recalled because of their role in the above crisis. While seconding the motion, Prof. F.O. Shaka, expressed dissatisfaction that at the 422nd Meeting (Extraordinary) of Senate held on Friday, 10th June, 2016, following the rumour of the suspension of the Vice-Chancellor, elected Senate Representatives in the Governing Council failed to brief Senate despite repeated calls. 

Senate deliberated extensively on the above motion and decided:

To make appropriate recommendations based on the findings, and any other recommendations incidental to its assignment as may be deemed appropriate and submit a report to Senate within eight weeks.

Senate recalled that at the 425th Meeting of Senate, following the Report of the Ag. Director of Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Office (IPPTO), Dr. T.A. Briggs, it had directed that the cases of the students be referred to the special committee charged with the responsibility of investigating allegations of plagiarism and plagiarism-related matters. 

However, in the above Report, Prof. Ugiomoh submitted that the students complied with due process in the submission of their dissertation for the first and second plagiarism tests contrary to Dr. Briggs’ submission. 
He claimed that it was the Faculty of Management Sciences that failed to properly convey the directives of the School of Graduate Studies to the concerned students. He further submitted that the students, after effecting corrections on their work, followed due process and resubmitted their work and some of them got the approval to defend. 
He alleged that it was after the above that IPTTO came up with the accusation of illegal re-run of their dissertation for the second time. He therefore appealed to Senate to allow the students to proceed with the defense of their work.
Senate deliberated on the matter and observed among other things that the Report was not signed by the members of the Professional Ethics Committee.

the Faculty of Engineering should adhere strictly to the University-wide Senate Policy on Waiver of one or two failed course(s);
Section 8.1 of the General Regulations and Statement of Academic Policies which exempted students of the Faculty of Engineering from the waiver of a maximum of two failed courses be amended with “Engineering” deleted from it;
given the arbitrariness in the graduation of some students through results “moderation”, the results of all students with one or two failed course(s) within the period under consideration (2009/2010 to 2015/2016 session) who did not benefit from the “moderation” should be computed by their respective departments (with the courses waived) and processed for Senate consideration and approval;
the Departments, External Examiners and the Board of the Faculty of Engineering should desist forthwith from the “moderation” of any Senate approved result. Any genuine correction of Senate approved result must follow the due process of re-presentation to Senate for consideration and approval;
a 3-member Degree Results Verification Committee in each Department be established to reconcile the entries/records by the Examination Officer(s) from Examination Course Mark Sheets to Spread Sheets and consequent computation of degree results;
results that were “moderated” by the Departments, External Examiners, Deans/Provost that are not in the Senate records should be re-presented for Senate consideration and approval. The Senate Business Committee should ensure that these results tally with the records in the Academic Office;
in considering the number of students who graduated from 2009/2010 to 2015/2016 session through these “moderations”, the image of the University of Port Harcourt and effluxion of time, Senate upheld the results of the students who benefitted from this process;
given the gross violation of Senate policy on waiver of two failed courses, and the deliberate deceit by the Faculty of Engineering in this regard, the Board of the Faculty of Engineering should be reprimanded by Senate;
in considering the poor mentorship and lack of harmonious working relationships among academic staff in the Faculty of Engineering, which may not be limited to the Faculty, there should be a structured University-wide orientation programme for newly employed academic staff as well as other academic staff in all Faculties and Departments;
that the Faculty of Engineering Board should furnish the Vice-Chancellor within 2 weeks the list of the core courses that cannot be waived.",Panel
